# BF2TS
An extremely basic implementation of Brainfuck in TypeScript.
This is not yet fully functional (e.g. some more complicated programs involving "," don't work), so feel free to leave feedback.
This package should be installed globally (`npm i -g bf2ts`), which gives access to the `bf2ts` command, which prompts you for code which you can submit, and `bf2tsf`, which requires a file (e.g. `bf2tsf file.js`) to work.
